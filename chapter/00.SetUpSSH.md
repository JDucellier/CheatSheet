# Set Up your SSH

- first of all generate key
  - <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jeanducellier.dev@gmail.com"</code>
- Then this text will be appear :

```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cyanurzz/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

> Skip it press enter

- Enter a password
- After that's you should have things like this :

```bash
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/cyanurzz/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/cyanurzz/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:o6afa9NW0P826N/3+0Zrn1Kl3P+oeMosx4+O37ka8o jeanducellier.dev@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+

|o=.              |

> My Key is now generated

- Then enter <code>eval \$(ssh-agent -s) </code> to get your agent pid
  _Now we need to add the ssh key so :
  _ <code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> > This is the default location if you haven't change it
  \*Then <code> clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub </code> or go to the path and copy the ssh key
